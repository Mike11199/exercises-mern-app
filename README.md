<h2>MERN Exercise App Portfolio Project - CS290 Web Development</h2>

Full stack MERN project, exercise tracker developed for CS290 as a portfolio project.  Per the class, this project is allowed to be posted to a public GitHub repo after the quarter ends.  Simple project demonstrating a view layer by react, model layer handled by Mongoose on the server side, and controller layer using Node/Express to handle requests by the front end.

This project must be downloaded and run with "npm start" on one terminal, to run the front-end on localhost:8000, and another terminal with "npm start" to run the server on localhost:3000.  I did not upload this to Heroku due to the simplicty of this project (see other complex projects done in my own time with user-login, authentication, JWT, etc.).

Front end sends requests to the Express server via Fetch API.  REST APIs on the Express server implemented by controllers connect with the Model layer to update the MongoDB collection/database for the exercises.
